        <h2>HELLO!</h2><p>My name is Andrii and it's my first website. Here I will be talking about my work expirience from my days in the university until now and hopefully this information will help you to think about starting your career as a web developer/desiner or somethink similar.<br> 
        I graduated Lviv Polytechnics National University as an Engineer but I couldn't find a job as an Engineer becouse I needed at least 4 years of expirience. After first year in the University I started getting low paying jobs and here I will be talking about some of them. 
        So lets get started ...</p><br>
